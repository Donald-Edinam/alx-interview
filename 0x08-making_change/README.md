The selected code snippet is an `if` statement in Python. It checks if the value of the variable `total` is less than or equal to zero. 

## Conditional Statements in Programming

In programming, `if` statements are used to make decisions based on certain conditions. The condition in this case is `total <= 0`. If the condition evaluates to `True`, the code block following the `if` statement will be executed. If the condition is `False`, the code block will be skipped.

In this specific case, if the value of `total` is less than or equal to zero, the code block following the `if` statement will be executed. The code block may contain one or more statements that will be executed if the condition is `True`. 

It's important to note that the indentation of the code is significant in Python. The code block following the `if` statement should be indented to indicate that it is part of the `if` statement. In Python, indentation is used to define the scope of code blocks, so it's crucial to ensure proper indentation for the code to work correctly.
